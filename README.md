# Multiplayer-TicTacToe
A multiplayer tictactoe game using Python.

**This project is discontinued and is in a very buggy state.**

DIRECTIONS FOR HOSTING A GAME:
1. If you want people to connect outside of your local network, port forward port 1234 (or whatever port the constant is set to if you changed it).
2. Finally, run the python file (this was made using Python 3.8, if this does program does not work, ensure that you are on Python 3.8).

DIRECTIONS TO CONNECT TO A HOST:
1. When prompted to input an IP, input the host's IP address. If you are *not* connecting via LAN, the host can find this IP by typing "what is my IP" in Google. If connecting via LAN, input the host's local IP address.
2. Input the port. This must match the PORT constant in the host's script. Default port is 1234.
